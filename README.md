# TransferENet-EpigeneticClock

This repository is dedicated to the data availability for the paper **Transfer Elastic Net for Developing Epigenetic Clocks for the Japanese Population**.

## Description

- This repository contains a Python script for implementing **Transfer Elastic Net** proposed in the paper, which can be found in the directory `transfer_elastic_net`.
- Once the paper is accepted, we will add a file containing the regression coefficients of the estimated epigenetic clocks to this repository.
